This is a simple project of translating the original Python-based FormCV to Java. The original idea of FormCV was to develop a mobile application to perform the whole image processing just after taking a picture of the form, but for simplicity reasons it was moved to a computer application.

After completing the first version, I decided to translate the image processing class to Java, as a first step for the possibility of developiong a mobile app and also to have some contact with Java.

After struggling a little bit with the transition from Python to Java, I managed to complete it!
