## The idea
This project started with two interesting discoveries:
1. Drone racing is a thrilling thing!
2. You can't learn it without breaking drones.

By this time, I had just assembled my 3D printer and I was ready to design anything I could imagine. So it all came together: 
I could start to practice drone racing if I designed a body for my recently bought drone, so fixing it would be a matter of 
printing a new body and changing parts.

## The project
So, being a beginner to 3D-printing and mechanical design in SolidWorks, I spent a lot of time testing and learning how to create models and print them.
My first steps in SolidWorks were, as I see now, 4 years later, small. It's personally good to see how practicing has been a good teacher.

The drone itself is a Hubsan X4 H107D. It's a cheap mini FPV quadcopter, a true bargain for a beginner. I will not go in 
details on the drone, since there's no change to its electronics. I basically got it, removed everything from the original 
body and assembled in my own design.

It was a very rewarding project, which I developed in 2 weeks. I did not manage to get any good any racing, though.
