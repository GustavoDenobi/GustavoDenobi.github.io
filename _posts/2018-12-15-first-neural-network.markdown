This is the first of 5 projects I developed as tests for the Deep Learning Nanodegree, from Udacity.

The first part of the course deals with the mathematical foundations of Deep Learning, so the project consisted in the development of a neural network model and its training algorithms in a lower level.

So, using only Numpy and Pandas, I dveloped the Deep Learning algorithms to train a model to predict bike usage based on environment factors like the season and temperature.
