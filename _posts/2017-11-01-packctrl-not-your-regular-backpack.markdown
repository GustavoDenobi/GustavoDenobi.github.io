As we grow up, certain things become part of who we are and define us. My backpack has been one of those things for a long time. The very first time I remember being associated with it was in a camp with my church. The pastor forgot the glue he'd use in a illustration, and so he asked, hopelessly, if anyone would have a glue. It was obvious nobody would, but I did! In another time, at the prom, two colleagues gave a speech, mentioning everyone's most remarkable characteristic. Well, I was "the one whose backpack has everything you need". In college, living 60Km away and going and returning everyday, my attachment to my bag increased even more.

## PackCTRL

Even before I got my 3D printer, I started to think about how I could use it to escalate the meaning of _the backpack that has everything you need_. This was the begin of PackCTRL!

The first version had a few features:
- It was based on a military backpack, with modular pockets;
- A modular panel on the top, designed mainly to be an interface, with connectors and buttons;
- A 20Ah powerbank;
- A Raspberry Pi 2 model B;

I used it for a couple months, until 13th July, 2017. In that day, I took my father to see the doctor and left my backpack in the car. After an hour, I came back to it and the backpack was gone! Such a shame!

By then, I was at my second year of Mechatronics Engineering, and there was a deadline to register projects until 30th July. Ater mourning for the robbery, I decided it was time to shake the dust off and restart it!

And so it begins... I had three months to build the PackCTRL 2.0!

## PackCTRL 2.0

Even before starting the project, I had a clear idea of the new features I wanted, and how I could enhance the features the first version had:

- A military backpack is a very good start point;
- The modular interface panel should be slightly different;
- An internal modular panel to accomodate, well, modules;
- Instead of a single big powerbank, a modular power system;
- Raspberry Pi 3 B, with dual boot (Raspbian and Retropie);
- More, different modules;
- A GPS tracker, for obvious reasons;

Modularity became a serious focus on the second version, as it makes the backpack flexible and suitable for my daily trips, for travelling and for other purposes - left to future demand.
