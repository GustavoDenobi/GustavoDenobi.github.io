This is the second of 5 projects I developed as tests for the Deep Learning Nanodegree, from Udacity. In this project, we developed a dog breed classifier usign fresh CNNs and transfer learning. Also, we used Haar Cascades to detect faces and humans in images, just before breed classification. You can check the results in the following notebook.

You can check it in [this notebook](https://github.com/GustavoDenobi/dog_breed_classification/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb).
